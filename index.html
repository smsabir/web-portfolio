            <h3>World-class Professional Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I live and work near Cleveland, Ohio. At my day job, I develop WordPress websites and cross-platform mobile apps. I also freelance when I can, mostly building custom websites and apps that you can’t get from a template.

            <h2>Big Dream</h2>
            <h3>Become a smart FullStack Developer</h3>
            <p>My place in the world seems to be at the intersection of creativity and logic. All projects are a problem to be solved, whether it’s to do with design or code—only the tools change. My process is iterative; I approach each problem as a learning experience that informs the rest of the project, which means that I tend to not rely on full design mockups. Most of the time, I do a few sketches to flesh out a concept, and immediately dive into a working prototype that is much more flexible than jumping back and forth between code and Photoshop.
